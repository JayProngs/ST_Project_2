## Import Data

```{r}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
df <- read.csv("SeoulBikeApp/SeoulBikeData.csv", sep=",", header=FALSE)
df <- df[-1, ]
colnames(df) <- c("Date", "Rented_Bike_Count", "Hour", "Temperature", "Humidity", 
                  "Wind_speed", "Visibility", "Dew_point_temperature", "Solar_Radiation",
                  "Rainfall", "Snowfall", "Seasons", "Holiday", "Functioning_Day")

df <- df %>%
  mutate(across(c(Rented_Bike_Count, Hour, Temperature, Humidity, Wind_speed,Visibility, Dew_point_temperature, Solar_Radiation, Rainfall, Snowfall, ), as.numeric))

```

## One-way Contingency Tables

```{r}
table(df$Seasons) # One-way
```

## Two-way Contingency Tables

```{r}
table(df$Seasons, df$Holiday) # Two-way
```

## Numerical Summaries

```{r}
# Summarize and print the result
summary_stats <- df |>
  group_by(Seasons) |>
  summarize(
    mean_rentals = mean(Rented_Bike_Count, na.rm = TRUE), 
    sd_rentals = sd(Rented_Bike_Count, na.rm = TRUE)
  )

# Print the result
print(summary_stats)


summary_stats <- df |>
  group_by(Holiday) |>
  summarize(
    mean_rentals = mean(Rented_Bike_Count, na.rm = TRUE), 
    sd_rentals = sd(Rented_Bike_Count, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
print(summary_stats)
```

## Plot 1: Scatter plot with smoothing

```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(x = Temperature, y = Rented_Bike_Count, color = Seasons)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6) +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Scatter Plot of Temperature vs. Bike Rentals",
       x = "Temperature (Â°C)", y = "Rented Bike Count") +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Plot 2: Box Plot with Grouping

```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(x = Seasons, y = Temperature, fill = Seasons)) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.color = "red") +
  facet_wrap(~ Functioning_Day) +
  labs(title = "Box Plot of Temperature by Season and Functioning Day",
       x = "Season", y = "Functioning_Day") +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Plot 3: Histogram with fill color by category and faceting by weather

```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(x = Rented_Bike_Count, fill = Seasons)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30, color = "black", alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(title = "Histogram of Bike Rentals by Season with Functioning Day Faceting",
       x = "Rented Bike Count", y = "Frequency") +
  facet_wrap(~ Functioning_Day) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set2") + # Change color palette if desired
  theme_minimal()
```

## Plot 4: Density plot with color by category (Seasons)

```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(x = Rented_Bike_Count, color = Seasons, fill = Seasons)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.4) +
  labs(title = "Density Plot of Bike Rentals by Season",
       x = "Rented Bike Count", y = "Density") +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set2") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set2") +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Plot 5: Heatmap of Rentals by Hour and Season

```{r}
df_hourly <- df %>%
  group_by(Hour, Seasons) %>%
  summarize(avg_rentals = mean(Rented_Bike_Count, na.rm = TRUE))

ggplot(df_hourly, aes(x = Hour, y = Seasons, fill = avg_rentals)) +
  geom_tile() +
  labs(title = "Heatmap of Average Bike Rentals by Hour and Season",
       x = "Hour", y = "Season", fill = "Avg Rentals") +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "white", high = "darkblue") +
  theme_minimal()

```

## Plot 6: Time Series Plot

```{r}
df$Date <- as.Date(df$Date, format = "%d/%m/%Y")
ggplot(df, aes(x = Date, y = Rented_Bike_Count, color = Seasons)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Time Series of Bike Rentals", x = "Date", y = "Rented Bike Count") +
  theme_minimal()
```
